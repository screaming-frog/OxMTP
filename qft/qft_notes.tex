\section{Why QFT?}
Our primary concern is with the behaviour of elementary particles and hence relativistic fields. Why must we quantize the fields and not the relativistic particles in the same way we do with non-relativistic particles? The reason can be demonstrated with the Klein-Gordon equation or Dirac equation, which result in inconsistencies such as negative energy states.\\

\subsection{Klein-Gordon}

\begin{itemize}

\item The energy-momentum-mass equation is given by:
\[E^{2}=p^{2}c^{2}+m^{2}c^{4}\]

\item Substitute the physical quantities of energy and momentum with their quantum mechanical operators: 

\noindent\begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
\begin{equation}
  E \rightarrow i\hbar\partial_{t}.
\end{equation}
\end{minipage}%
\begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
\begin{equation}
  p \rightarrow -i\hbar\nabla.
\end{equation}
\end{minipage}

\[implies -\hbar^{2}\partial_{tt}^{2}\psi = \]

\item Examples include:
\begin{itemize}u
\item the {\bf double slit experiment} (done with light by Thomas Young in 1801, and with electrons by Tonomura in 1986)
\item the photoelectric effect (analyzed by Einstein in 1905 --- in fact his Nobel-winning work)
\item the ``quantum Venn diagram'' puzzle, involving the overlaps of three polarizing filters
\item the stability of the hydrogen atom (i.e., the fact that the electron doesn't lose energy and spiral inward toward the proton).
\end{itemize}

How now, brown cow?

\begin{defn}
The {\em Feynman kernel} is given by
\[ K(x_b, t_b; x_a, t_a) = \int_{x(t_a) = x_a}^{x(t_b) = x_b} e^{(i/\hbar) S[x(t)]} \; \mathcal{D}x(t). \]
\end{defn}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mon, Sept 9: Review of Newtonian Mechanics}

\begin{itemize}

\item  A {\em Newtonian trajectory} ${\bf x}(t)$ ($t \in \R$) is given by solutions of the second order ODE
\[ m\, \ddot{{\bf x}}(t) = {\bf F}({\bf x}(t)), \]
where $m > 0$ is a basic parameter associated with a given Newtonian particle, called its {\em mass}.

\item The force field ${\bf F}({\bf x})$ --- which we take to be static (i.e., not intrinsically dependent on time) for simplicity --- is said to be {\em conservative} if there is a {\em potential function} $V({\bf x})$ such that
\[ {\bf F}({\bf x}) = -\nabla V({\bf x}). \]
Here, `$\nabla$' denotes the {\em gradient operator}, 
\[ \nabla V = \bigg( \frac{\partial V}{\partial x}, \, \frac{\partial V}{\partial y}, \, \frac{\partial V}{\partial z} \bigg). \]

\item For a conservative force field, we can find a {\em conserved quantity} along the Newtonian trajectories, namely the {\em total mechanical energy}.
\[ E = H({\bf x}, {\bf p}) := \frac{1}{2m}\, {\bf p}^2 + V({\bf x}). \]
Here, ${\bf p}^2 := {\bf p} \Cdot {\bf p} = \| {\bf p} \|^2$, and ${\bf p} := m {\bf v} := m \dot{{\bf x}}$ is the {\em momentum}.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tue, Sept 10: Alternative Formulations of Newtonian Mechanics}

\begin{itemize}

\item The {\bf Hamiltonian formulation}:
\[ \dot{{\bf x}} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial {\bf p}}, \;\;\;\;\; \dot{{\bf p}} = - \frac{\partial H}{\partial {\bf x}}. \]

\item The {\bf Lagrangian formulation}:
\[ \delta S[{\bf x}(t)] = 0, \]
where the {\em action} on the time interval $[t_a, t_b]$ is given by
\[ S[{\bf x}(t)] := \int_{t_a}^{t_b} \bigg[ \frac{m}{2} \, \dot{{\bf x}}(t)^2 - V({\bf x}(t)) \bigg]  \; dt. \]

\item Etc.

\end{itemize}
